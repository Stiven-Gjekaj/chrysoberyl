# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-09-06)

**Core value:** A baseline is portable. The same pair gives the same verdict on any machine, any GPU and any driver.
**Current focus:** Phase 3 - Baseline, rules and CI gate

## Current Position

Phase: 3 (Baseline, rules and CI gate) — READY TO PLAN
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Phases 1 and 2 executed. Neither has a canonical VERIFICATION.md.
Last activity: 2026-09-07

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 25%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 13
- Token estimate factor: 0.5 (13 samples, high confidence)
- Actual tokens per plan: 4850 to 14869

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 1 | 8 | executed, verification report missing |
| 2 | 5 | executed, verification report missing |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: phase 2, waves 1 through 5
- Trend: estimates run about twice the actual token cost

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: merged research's suggested Phase 1 (raster spine) and Phase 2 (determinism CI) into one Phase 1, so the determinism proof lands as that phase's exit gate, not a separate later phase.
- Roadmap: moved VIEW-01 through VIEW-04 to Phase 6, alongside the wgpu mirror, because the native window is built on Slint hosting a wgpu canvas and cannot exist before that infrastructure does.
- Roadmap: kept PDF (Phase 5), video (Phase 7), and mesh (Phase 8) as single-requirement phases, because each carries exactly one new kind of risk and the project's sequencing constraint puts risk isolation ahead of packing phases full.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 5 (PDF): pdfium's cross-platform determinism is an unproven claim. The phase is not done until a golden-image test settles it, or the feature is withdrawn from v1 in writing.
- Phase 6 (wgpu mirror): GPU cross-vendor categorical equivalence is an unproven claim. The phase is not done until tested on at least three GPU vendors. Budget a spike first; the author has no prior GPU work.
- Phase 7 (video): decode bit-exactness across hardware/software and across codec paths is the master unproven claim in the whole roadmap, and is PROJECT.md's own Open Question. The phase is not done until a conformance-corpus test settles it per codec path, or the path is withdrawn.
- Phase 8 (mesh): no mature Rust crate exists for CPU mesh rasterization. It is written by hand. Budget a spike first, and prove determinism with the same golden cross-OS/cross-architecture hash mechanism used for SVG.
